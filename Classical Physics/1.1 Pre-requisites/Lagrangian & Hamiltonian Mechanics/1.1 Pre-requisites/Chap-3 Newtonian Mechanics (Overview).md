## 1.1 Newtonian Mechanics Overview

### What is Newtonian Mechanics?

- The foundation of classical physics.

- Describes the motion of objects using forces and mass.

- Based on Newton’s three laws of motion.

- Time and space are absolute (unlike in relativity).

### Why It Matters for Theoretical Physics:

- Used to define Lagrangians and Hamiltonians.

- Helps bridge into quantum and relativistic frameworks.

- Important for understanding action principles and conservation laws.

## 1.2 Newton’s Three Laws

### First Law (Inertia):

An object stays at rest or in uniform motion unless acted on by a force.

### Second Law (F = ma):

Force equals mass times acceleration.

### Third Law (Action-Reaction):

For every action, there’s an equal and opposite reaction.

- Normal force: perpendicular contact force

- Friction: opposes motion

- Tension: force in strings/ropes

- Spring force (Hooke’s Law):
