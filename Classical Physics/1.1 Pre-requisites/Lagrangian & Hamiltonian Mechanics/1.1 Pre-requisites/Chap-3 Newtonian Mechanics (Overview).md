## 1.1 Newtonian Mechanics Overview

### üß± What Is Newtonian Mechanics?
Newtonian mechanics - also called classical mechanics - is the framework developed by Isaac Newton in the 17th century to describe how objects move. It‚Äôs the bedrock of physics before Einstein‚Äôs relativity and quantum mechanics came along.

- The **foundation of classical physics**.
- Describes **how objects move** when forces act on them.
- Assumes **time and space are absolute** (fixed and universal).
- Works well for:
  - Cars, planets, projectiles, falling objects, etc.
  - **Everyday speeds and scales**
- It **fails** at very fast speeds (near light) or very small sizes (quantum level).

### üìú Newton‚Äôs Three Laws of Motion

1. **First Law (Law of Inertia)**  
   An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion - unless a force acts on it.

   > No force ‚Üí no change in motion.

2. **Second Law**  
   Force causes acceleration:

   - ![](https://quicklatex.com/cache3/96/ql_a8b006554cfc5c0836cc1684ad1b0596_l3.png): force  
   - ![](https://quicklatex.com/cache3/a3/ql_0227d48867abaeafc29045960b271aa3_l3.png): mass  
   - ![](https://quicklatex.com/cache3/64/ql_04c710828a62bedc6f61a8b2dd43de64_l3.png): acceleration

   > More force ‚Üí more acceleration. More mass ‚Üí harder to move.

3. **Third Law**  
   Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.

   > If you push something, it pushes back just as hard.

---

### üß† Key Concepts

- **Force**: A push or pull that causes change in motion.
- **Mass**: Resistance to acceleration (how ‚Äúinert‚Äù an object is).
- **Acceleration**: Change in velocity (speed or direction).
- **Velocity**: Speed **with direction** (e.g. 20 m/s to the right).
- **Inertia**: Tendency to keep doing what it‚Äôs doing (motion or rest).

---

### üî≠ Why Learn This?

- Newtonian mechanics is the **starting point** for all theoretical physics.
- It builds intuition for more advanced topics:
  - **Relativity** (when speeds are high)
  - **Quantum Mechanics** (when sizes are small)
  - **Field Theory** (when forces are continuous across space)

### Why It Matters for Theoretical Physics:

- Used to define Lagrangians and Hamiltonians.

- Helps bridge into quantum and relativistic frameworks.

- Important for understanding action principles and conservation laws.

## 1.2 Newton‚Äôs Three Laws and Kinematics

### ‚öñÔ∏è First Law (Law of Inertia)

An object stays at rest or moves in a straight line at constant speed  
**unless a force acts on it**.

This means motion doesn‚Äôt change on its own.

### üèãÔ∏è Second Law (Force = mass √ó acceleration)

The total force causes acceleration. It depends on mass:

- ![](https://quicklatex.com/cache3/64/ql_04c710828a62bedc6f61a8b2dd43de64_l3.png): acceleration (m/s¬≤)

More force ‚Üí more acceleration  
More mass ‚Üí harder to accelerate

---

### üîÅ Third Law (Action‚ÄìReaction)

For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

If object A pushes on object B,  
then object B pushes back equally on A.

## 1.3 Forces You Should Know

In Newtonian mechanics, all motion comes from **forces**.  
These are the most common forces in physics problems:

---

### üåç Gravitational Force

The force between any two objects with mass:

![](https://quicklatex.com/cache3/01/ql_003a2040972e2fc21208cdb6d8053d01_l3.png)

![](https://quicklatex.com/cache3/49/ql_4dd57e04589e31a174a43d8413001e49_l3.png)

- ![](https://quicklatex.com/cache3/f1/ql_5f9222a14bdc7e8e8bb65bbbc8b56df1_l3.png): gravitational constant  
- ![](https://quicklatex.com/cache3/65/ql_a8aeb986aadd70f53ffcb08d6e0a7565_l3.png): the two masses  
- ![](https://quicklatex.com/cache3/8b/ql_84d73bb162edb5240446412a54ca848b_l3.png): distance between them  
- **Always attractive**

For objects near Earth‚Äôs surface, we usually simplify it to:

---

### üß± Normal Force

- The force a surface applies **perpendicular** to itself  
- Balances gravity when objects rest on surfaces  
- Changes based on angle and applied forces

---

### üõë Friction

- A force that **opposes motion** between two surfaces  
- Two types:
  - **Static friction**: prevents motion from starting  
  - **Kinetic friction**: resists motion that's already happening

Friction force formula:

Where:
- ![](https://quicklatex.com/cache3/ec/ql_275c276ad516930b74297017b2c378ec_l3.png): coefficient of friction (depends on surface)  
- ![](https://quicklatex.com/cache3/e5/ql_284a29e15703cdad999707e991f520e5_l3.png): normal force

---

### ü™¢ Tension

- The pulling force in **strings, ropes, or cables**  
- Tension is **the same** throughout a massless rope  
- Acts **away** from the object it pulls

---

### üåÄ Spring Force (Hooke‚Äôs Law)

Springs **push or pull** back when stretched or compressed:

![](https://quicklatex.com/cache3/f4/ql_2c765691bb3e7b57e02c6d4e1b1fc3f4_l3.png)

- ![](https://quicklatex.com/cache3/16/ql_c07a3347bbe5ba8adbcbe04e49c05f16_l3.png): spring constant (stiffness)  
- ![](https://quicklatex.com/cache3/b4/ql_78d8daa270eff05379259b201fd9b5b4_l3.png): displacement from rest position  
- The minus sign means it pulls **back toward equilibrium**
