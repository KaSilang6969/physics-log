## 1.1 What is Electromagnetism (For Theoretical Physics)

* Electromagnetism is the theory of electric and magnetic fields, and their interaction with charges and currents.
* It unifies electricity, magnetism, and light as one force.
* Basis for:

  * Maxwell's equations
  * Special relativity
  * Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)

## 1.8 Applications in Theoretical Physics

* **Quantum Electrodynamics** (QED): quantized version of EM field
* **Gauge theory**: local U(1) symmetry gives rise to electromagnetism
* **Relativity**: Maxwell’s theory is Lorentz invariant
* **Black holes**: Charged black holes (Reissner–Nordström)
* **String theory**: EM fields arise from open string endpoints
