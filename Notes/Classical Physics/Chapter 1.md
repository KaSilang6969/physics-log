Minimization is a fundamental concept in mathematics and physics, used to describe how systems naturally settle into states of equilibrium. In many physical systems, the equilibrium state is the one that minimizes a certain quantity, such as energy. By expressing this idea mathematically, we can create models that predict how systems will behave under various conditions.

The Calculus of Variations is a branch of mathematics that focuses on finding functions that minimize (or sometimes maximize) certain quantities. Unlike standard calculus, which deals with optimization in finite-dimensional spaces (like finding the minimum of a function of a few variables), the Calculus of Variations works with infinite-dimensional spacesâ€”specifically, spaces of functions. This allows us to study more complex problems, such as finding the shape of a curve or surface that minimizes energy, area, or other physical quantities. The principles of minimization in these settings often lead to non-linear problems, making the study both rich and challenging.
