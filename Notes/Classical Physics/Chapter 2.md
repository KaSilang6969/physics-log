🔢 What Is a Complex Conjugate?
A complex number is typically written as:

𝑧
=
𝑎
+
𝑏
𝑖
𝑎
: real part

𝑏
: imaginary part

𝑖
: imaginary unit, where 
𝑖
2
=
−
1

The complex conjugate of 
𝑧
 is:

𝑧
ˉ
=
𝑎
−
𝑏
𝑖
So, you simply flip the sign of the imaginary part.

🪞 Geometric Interpretation
In the complex plane (Argand diagram), the complex conjugate is the mirror image of the original number across the real axis.

If 
𝑧
=
3
+
4
𝑖
, then 
𝑧
ˉ
=
3
−
4
𝑖

Visually, this reflects the point from the upper half-plane to the lower half-plane

🧮 Key Properties
Conjugate of a real number: It’s the number itself (since 
𝑏
=
0
)

Conjugate of a purely imaginary number: Just flip the sign

Product with its conjugate:

𝑧
⋅
𝑧
ˉ
=
𝑎
2
+
𝑏
2
=
∣
𝑧
∣
2
→ Always a real number

Sum with its conjugate:

𝑧
+
𝑧
ˉ
=
2
𝑎
→ Twice the real part

Difference:

𝑧
−
𝑧
ˉ
=
2
𝑏
𝑖
→ Twice the imaginary part

📐 Polar Form Insight
If 
𝑧
=
𝑟
𝑒
𝑖
𝜃
, then:

𝑧
ˉ
=
𝑟
𝑒
−
𝑖
𝜃
This flips the angle 
𝜃
 to 
−
𝜃
, reflecting the point across the real axis.
